# first_tf_project
This is my first project on github. This project is done taking into consideration the learned techniques from the TensorFlow in Practice Specilization from Coursera Platform. It involves using tensor flow for image classifier using real world images.

These will be series of project in which the efficiency of model is documented in terms of hyperparameters tuning to learn more about models.
